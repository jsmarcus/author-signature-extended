# Author Signature Extended

This plugin adds the author signature to the end of posts and pages. It also adds a shortcode to allow the insertion of the signature elsewhere through the site. Current settings include the ability to enable/disable for posts/pages, choose which name to display (first, last, nice, display), and set and prefix or suffix.
